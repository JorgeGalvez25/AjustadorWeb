This demo uses the "Rave Reports" components as included in Delphi 7.

If you don't have Delphi 7 then please go to http://www.nevrona.com/rave/
and download the demo version of "Rave 5.0 BEX (Borland Edition eXtended)".
This demo will work while your Delphi IDE is running and is available for
Delphi 5, 6 and 7. (A Delphi 4 version is also available, but IW neads at least
Delphi 5)

Please note that Rave is NOT thread safe if using Direct Data Views,
see the comments in Unit1.pas which are explaining how to avoid threading issues.
